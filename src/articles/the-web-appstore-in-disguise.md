Web 1.0 => Web 2.0
App store a dirty word
What is a document? What is an app? What is an app store?

# Who did the web evolve the way it did?
Historical context. What could have doomed the web.

# Issues with the direction the emerging web took

# What if the WebStore 1.0 was made today?

# Final words
